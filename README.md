## Overview

This is a peer to peer messaging app using the [Iroh Gossip Protocol](https://www.iroh.computer/proto/iroh-gossip) to send messages between peers sharing a Room.

Messages are sent as events to all connected peers directly, are encrypted
as standard and are not persisted anywhere other than on your device.

This is a proof of concept based heavily on the [Iroh Chat Example](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-examples/tree/main/browser-chat) and modified for a [Tauri App](https://tauri.app/).

This is designed for mobile first and has been tested heavily on Android.
